                WEB APPLICATIONS

-Webpage communictes w the Webserver
-Webserver communicates w the Application Server
-App Server communicates w Database

-when you enter stuff on webpage, it's written in HTML (javascript, CSS, etc.)
-that info is sent to the Webserver
-translated on App Server
-interacts w Database

2 types of Requests
-GET REQUEST: initially the webpage is loaded, and it's GETTING the info from the database
    # starts at Database -> sends to Application Server ->
    # Webserver: translates to python/HTML code -> displays on Webpage
-POST REQUEST: update info on database; sends info to be POSTED on database
    # starts when you make an update on your Webpage -> Webserver ->
    # Application Server -> saved on Database

                DJANGO

-OOP/no SQL (uses dot notation)

-models.py
    # where we define tables (objects)
-views.py
    # python code that interacts w/ the HTML(Webpage) and the database
-urls.py
    # specific location of the Webpages(HTMLs)
-templates.py
    # 


                MODIFYING THE DATABASE

2 steps whenever we make a change to the database (models.py)
1. python3 manage.py makemigrations
2. python3 manage.py migrate

                MAKING A WEB PAGE

-making a Webpage w Django consists of 3 stages:
    # 1: defining URLs
        -gives a page location OR address
        -in the address, you give which View you want associated w the URl
        -URL always points to a view
    # 2: writing views
        -a python function that interacts w the Database
        -uses a template to display on browser
        -the view contains the data
        -create a function in the view
    # 3: writing templates
        -template is a skeleton that contains all formatting

    # View and template work tog to upload to the browser
    # View grabs info from database
